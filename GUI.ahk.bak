************************************************************************************************
ShiftGameWindow Known Issues:
 - If the top-left corner of the window is off-screen, ShiftGameWindow can't reposition the
   window properly.
 - If the top-left corner of the window is on or under the Taskbar, ShiftGameWindow can't
   reposition the window properly.
 - Sometimes a game in windowed mode won't render at the correct resolution. ShiftGameWindow
   will process these normally, but the results won't be normal. Usually when this happens the
   game just needs to be restarted. I've seen this behaviour in COD4, CODWaW, Loadout, and
   Titanfall.
   

TO DO:
 - Recreate ShiftGameWindow with a proper GUI.
 - Create icon.
 - Compile.
