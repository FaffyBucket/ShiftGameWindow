	ShiftGameWindow is a tool for repositioning windowed games running at
	native resolution. Assign it to a keyboard shortcut so that you can run it
	at the press of a button while in game. When it launches it will reposition
	the game to fill your screen.
	`n
	`nThe controls:
	`n - YES: Saves the current window position and exits ShiftGameWindow.
	`n - NO: Exits ShiftGameWindow without saving. Closing ShiftGameWindow will
	also exit without saving.

	`n
	`nMake sure that the TOP-LEFT corner of the game you want to reposition is
	clearly on the monitor workspace. If it is on/near the edge of the screen,
	or the StartMenu/Taskbar area, ShiftGameWindow will have problems detecting
	the window.
	`n
	`nMake sure that the game resolution MATCHES the monitor resolution.
	`n
	`nSome games do not display at the correct resolution when in windowed
	mode. This can usually be corrected by restarting the game. However, if the
	game won't display at the correct resolution, then ShiftGameWindow may not
	work. You can try resizing it in the Advanced section.

************************************************************************************************
ShiftGameWindow Known Issues:
 - If the top-left corner of the window is off-screen, ShiftGameWindow can't reposition the
   window properly.
 - If the top-left corner of the window is on or under the Taskbar, ShiftGameWindow can't
   reposition the window properly.
 - Sometimes a game in windowed mode won't render at the correct resolution. ShiftGameWindow
   will process these normally, but the results won't be normal. Usually when this happens the
   game just needs to be restarted. I've seen this behaviour in COD4, CODWaW, Loadout, and
   Titanfall.
   

TO DO:
 - Recreate ShiftGameWindow with a proper GUI.
 - Create icon.
 - Compile.
